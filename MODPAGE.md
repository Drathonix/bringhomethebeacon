# Bring Home the Beacon

Ever placed a beacon next to your house at the top of a mountain, sure you have buffs there but as soon as you go one block too deep, the buff is gone. The solution: place the beacon at the bottom of the world instead, now the entire world height is covered by the beacons effect!

This is honestly a ridiculous limitation imposed by the vanilla beacon code, it prevents using beacons as functional decoration at higher world heights.

This mod does one thing: makes beacons cover the entire world height regardless of their own height which allows beacons to be placed at y 200 and still apply effects below y 150.

Now you can bring home the beacon!
